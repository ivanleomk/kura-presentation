# Introducing Kura - Making sense of Data at scale

A comprehensive presentation exploring how to understand what's really happening in your LLM applications through intelligent topic modeling and advanced data analysis techniques.

## About This Presentation

This Slidev presentation delves into the critical challenges facing modern LLM applications, particularly the issue of silent failures that can go undetected using traditional monitoring approaches. The presentation examines how conventional methods often fall short when dealing with the complexity and scale of LLM-generated data.

The talk introduces Kura's innovative approach to data fusion and intelligent analysis, demonstrating how organizations can gain deeper insights into their LLM applications' behavior. Through real-world examples and case studies, the presentation showcases classification techniques specifically designed for LLM data and outlines comprehensive processing workflows that enable understanding at large scale.

Attendees will learn about the evolution from simple inventory-based monitoring to capability-driven analysis, and discover how Kura's methodology can help identify patterns and anomalies that traditional tools miss.
